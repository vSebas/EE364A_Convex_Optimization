\section*{A6.27 Properties of least-$p$-norm solutions}


\textbf{(a)}
\textbf{Unreasonable.} The $\ell_2$ norm is smooth, so the solution $x^\star = A^\dagger b$ spreads effort across all components. No sparsity is expected.

\textbf{(b)}
\textbf{Reasonable.} The $\ell_1$ ball has corners on the axes. The optimal point typically lies at a corner, giving at most $m$ nonzeros. Since $m \ll n$, most components are zero.

\textbf{(c)}
\textbf{Reasonable.} The $\ell_\infty$ ball is a box. The optimal point lies on a face, where many components hit the bounds $\pm\|x^\star\|_\infty$.
